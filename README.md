# create_solo_session_in_gta
For those of you who wishes a quicker way to create a solo session in GTA V online.


Version 1.0 


Instructions:
- You only have to drag the shortcut to your desktop (or somewhere else), rename it if you like to and it's ready to use.

Warning:
- Only for 64bit systems atm, send me a message on discord if you need it for a 32bit system.
